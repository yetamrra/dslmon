# If a modem-${MODEM_TYPE} file is found in the same directory
# as the main script, it will be sourced to pull stats from the
# modem.  The script should not produce any output, but should set
# the following variables:
#   *  BWDN: Integer downstream bandwidth in Kbps, e.g. 7114
#   *  BWUP: Integer upstream bandwidth in Kbps, e.g. 896
#   *  SNRDN: Decimal downstream SNR margin in dB, e.g. 10.1
#   *  SNRUP: Decimal upstream SNR margin in dB, e.g. 7.2
#   *  UPDAYS: Number of full days since the last line change, or
#          blank if none.  If it makes more sense, this can also
#          be left blank and reported in UPHOURS rather than breaking
#          out days separately.
#   *  UPHOURS: Number of full hours since the last line change, or
#          blank if none.
#   *  UPMINS: Number of full minutes since the last line change, or
#          blank if none.
# UPDAYS, UPHOURS, and UPMINS together represent the uptime of the line.
# For example, if the last connection happened 27h 55m 27s ago, this
# could be reported as UPDAYS=1, UPHOURS=3, UPMINS=55.
#
# Set to "none" to indicate that modem stats should not be attempted.

# Set to the IP of your modem.  Modem stats will not be collected if an IP is
# not set.  If running the script on the modem, set to 127.0.0.1.
MODEM_IP=

# If running this script directly on the router connected to the internet,
# set this to the name of the interface that has the external IP.
# Leave blank if the external IP can't be determined directly on the
# machine running the main script.
#
# Set to "detect" to try to detect the appropriate interface name based
# on the default route.
EXTERNAL_IFACE=

# Set to the name of some external host that responds to pings so that
# latency can be measured.  Potentially a good idea to set this to the
# same host as BASE_URL so that you are measuring the latency to
# somewhere meaningful to yourself.
PING_HOST=google.com

# Full path where local stats will be logged.
# Set to /dev/null if you don't want to save logs locally.
LOGFILE="/tmp/uplog.$(date +%Y%m).csv"

# The base URL that should be contacted to record stats.  The following
# additional query parameters will be appended:
#   *  ?YYYYMMDDHHMMSS: The local time of the beginning of the request.
#          This can be matched up to the time recorded in the server logs
#          to determine the timezone offset or any delays in the HTTP
#          request.
#   *  &d=$BWDN: Downstream bandwidth from the modem, if known.
#   *  &u=$BWUP: Upstream bandwidth from the modem, if known.
#   *  &t=$UPTIME: Modem's reported connection uptime in the format
#          HHH:MM (no separate days), if known.
# You must set this or the script will not attempt to submit remote stats.
BASE_URL=

# Number of seconds to wait for connecting to the external host when
# submitting stats.  An additional 2s will be allowed for the request
# to complete once the connection is established.
